If you want to add custom oneliners for MODDED agents, you can do so directly on your end of the mod. Full instructions inside this mod, and also on this page:

https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1658929029/4778901811098558859/

The same folder as this rreadme contains a TEMPLATE
 for modded agents that you can modify.

Check for_modinit.lua for code to put in your modinit to make the template work.

Finally, locationspecific_banters_TEMPLATE.lua contains both a template and instructions on adding those lines in.
